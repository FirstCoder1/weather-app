Whether-App

This is a default React app created with Yarn. It is a single-page application (SPA) that uses React and Webpack to bundle and optimize the code. This app includes some basic configuration files and folder structure to get you started with building your own React app.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run yarn to install the required dependencies.
Run yarn start to start the development server.
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
